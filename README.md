Short story.

I'm an avid user of SongBird, the late Mozilla-based music player.

Three days ago, I had to find an replacement. I had been fiddling on a C# variant of a music player, for Tabletop RPGs, so I knew where to start (i.e. .NET's MediaPlayer).

So... This is it.

The aim is to have a music player that reproduces the features of SongBird I was using.

I know the current .NET implementation of the MediaPlayer is a bit barebones (no support for .OGG files, and, as far as I know, no support for filemetada), but my aim is to have a player able to handle multiple playlists among a local directory-based music repository. I will deal with the metadata later.

:-)
